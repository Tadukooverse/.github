blurb: How to get support for Tadukooverse projects
---
If you need help with any of the projects in Tadukooverse, you can check for guides on [the website](https://tadukooverse.github.io), specifically under the 
particular [project page](https://tadukooverse.github.io/projects.html). We have guides for common usage of our projects linked from the project pages themselves.

If you have a specific question, you may be able to find the answer on our [FAQ](https://tadukooverse.github.io/about/faq.html).

If you need support beyond the above resources, you can ask questions on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cWzhbU7), or you can email us at tadukooverse@gmail.com
