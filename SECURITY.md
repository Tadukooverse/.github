## Supported Versions
When we setup proper releases, this section will be updated with the actual versions of the software we support. Currently everything is 
too early in development.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, send an email to tadukooverse@gmail.com with "[SECURITY VULNERABILITY]" in the subject line. 
We will try to get back to you in a timely manner, but since it is urgent, if you don't receive a reply quickly, please get in touch privately 
with the highest ranking member of the Tadukooverse organization that you can (through whatever means necessary). Please use public 
communication such as GitHub issues only as a last resort.

Ways to contact people:
- tadukooverse@gmail.com
- Their own email addresses (may be listed under the [Contributors](https://tadukooverse.github.io/contributors.html) page on the website)
- On our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cWzhbU7)
- GitHub Issues (LAST RESORT)
